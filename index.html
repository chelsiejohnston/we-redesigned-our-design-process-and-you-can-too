          <h1>Our Old Process</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>One “Design Lead” present during the discovery phase of the project</li>
            <li>“Design Lead” would have a “Design Requirements Meeting” with the client</li>
            <li>Three designers submit one design each in a <s>DESIGN SMACKDOWN</s> "friendly design contest"</li>
            <li>Design Lead meets again with the clients after two weeks; client selects one fo the three designs</li>
          </ul>          
        </section>        

        <section>
          <h2>Old Process: Cons</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Cost of doing this - in dollas</li>
            <li>Cost of doing this - in time</li>
            <li>Lots of design happening in a vacuum</li>
            <li>Lots of the client's ideas getting lost in translation</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Old Process: EXPENSIVE</h2>
          <p>One Final Design = Design Lead + (Designers * 3)</p>
          <p>Sadness = 25 hours + (25 hours * 3)</p>
          <p>Factor in time spent going back and forth with the client...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Old Process: Time Consuming!</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Design Requirements Meeting = one day</li>
            <li>Design brief deliverable = one week</li>
            <li>Design Call = one day</li>
            <li>Three designers designing = two weeks</li>
            <li>Design presentation = one day</li>
            <li>Client design selection & mods = one week</li>
            <li>Revisions... etc. = the time it takes to grow a long beard</li>
            <li>Client design signoff (approval to build) = one week</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This could take <strong>6 weeks</strong>, often longer.</p>

          <h2>Our New Design Process</h2>

        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>When we think we know enough about the client's requirements to move forward with def/doc, then the designer takes over for a few weeks.</li>

        </section>

        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>The designer works one-on-one with the client in iterative, hands-on sessions.</li>

        </section>

        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>Over a series of in-person meetings, the designer and the client work together to create the final design, which then gets approved by the client and built by a developer.</li>

          <h2>New Process: Pros</h2>

            <li>Design no longer happens in a vacuum; client involved in decison making</li>            
            <li>Client can build a sense of ownership over the product</li>

            <li>I identified how the main points seemed to emerge, and how they related to one another</li>
            <li>I talked to the other designers about it</li>
            <li>We drafted up some concrete changes based on our conversations</li>
