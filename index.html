          <aside class="notes">Other than those two fascinating tidbits of information, it’s probably also important for you to know that I'm a Front End Developer and Designer for Web Services at the University of Chicago. I’ve been there for about three years. I work on mostly Drupal projects— lots of site building, lots of theming. I designed built my first website at the age of 10 (it was an online Pokemon RPG, and the layout was made in Paint Shop Pro, sliced up into tables)</aside>

We're a smallish web shop— we have around 25 people— and all of our clients are associated with the University of Chicago in some way. So: departments, graduate programs, research initiatives, museums, etc.— they don't <em>have</em> to come to us, but we're really well positioned to meet their needs since we're officially part of the University. / Some things we've done— we won a webby a few years ago for the main University website, uchicago.edu; we also manage and develop Drupal as a service offering— affectionately named Templatron— that our clients can spin up at a lower cost</aside>

              <aside class="notes">My roommate works in advertising as a copywriter; ad agencies will, believe it or not, have finalized copy before designing anything.
We talked about this over drinks one night.
And the next day, I spoke with some coworkers about how amazing it would be if we had content from our clients up front, before we designed anything.
...What if?
But it wasn’t the right time. Nobody cared. People shot it down. There were bigger fish to fry. And besides, we have a hard enough time getting content from clients as it is, after we’ve developed an entire CMS. 
And I wasn’t ready. I wasn’t ready to defend myself. It had just been an idea. It was half baked. That was it. I knew what it would take to give an idea traction, and I hadn’t done any of it. So I let it go. 
For the moment. :)</aside>

              <aside class="notes">Also, every process needs room to grow and improve when it first starts out. The only way we can figure out how to improve our processes is if we give them a test drive— see what’s working, what isn’t working. It’s a little painful— but they’re just growing pains. Be optimistic.
If you really care about this as much as I'm assuming you do (if you choose to accept this challenge), you should want to understand the shortcomings of your new process. That's the only way to make your process stronger.</aside>

Don’t let that discourage you. What I want you to get out of this talk is the whys, most of all— why I believed this could happen, why it’s important… if you get hows out of it, that’s great. But the most important thing here is the bigger picture— the vision of what your organization could be. If you are really committed to that vision, people will start to notice, and your influence will grow. But it takes time. And you have to be unwavering. If you stop at nothing, you can influence things.
